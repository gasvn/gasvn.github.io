## Motivation
Precision therapy faces challenges such as individual variability, high costs, and ethical concerns. While large language models (LLMs) hold promise for enabling precision therapy, they are limited by issues like hallucinations and vague analyses due to outdated medical knowledge. 
This work presents BioAgent, which utilizes LLM-driven AI agents to provide scalable and precise drug reasoning solutions by harnessing massive number of tools that integrate the latest biomedical knowledge.

## Method
BioAgent processes complex therapeutic problems by integrating human input and autonomously performing multi-step reasoning and function calls to develop solutions. It leverages a vast toolkit of over 200 real-world biomedical tools sourced from platforms like Open Targets, openFDA, and the Monarch Initiative.
