# Orbital Angular Momentum for Wireless Communications
  As the traditional resources (frequency, time, space, etc.) are efficiently utilized, it becomes more and more challenging to satisfy the ever-lasting capacity-growing and users-boosting demand in wireless networks. Recently, the electromagnetic (EM) wave was found to possess not only linear momentum, but also angular momentum. The orbital angular momentum (OAM) is a kind of wavefront with helical phase. The OAM-based vortex wave has different topological charges, which are orthogonal to each other, bridging a new way for multiple access in wireless communications.
